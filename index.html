            <p>I got my start in tech back in 2020 when I was working as a radio technician for the Air National Guard. That experience really lit a fire in me and I’ve been diving into all things tech ever since. I’m a proud Romeo High School alum and now I’m over at Oakland University studying IT. If everything goes according to plan, I’ll be donning the cap and gown in December 2024. In my spare time, you can find me learning how to write scripts to automate tasks and getting my feet wet with full-stack web development.</p>
